# ipflare

## about

This small utility can help with operating a web service from behind a dynamic IP address - similar to dynamic DNS. It is useful for home services when your ISP does not make it possible to allocate a static IP address.

## requirements

   * CRON or similar scheduling mechanism
   * cloudflare account & API key
   * own domain
   * go (build-time)

## how does it work?
